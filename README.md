# Code Quiz

## Description

This website is a quiz based platform, that is also like a game. Upon clicking start, a user is prompted with a series of questions, and if guessed wrong will be a penalty. Users score is based on how many answers are answered correctly. And get stored to local storage so the user can keep track of his/her progress.

- My motivation to build this application was to expand my knowledge in JavaScript, Local Storage, Timer Interval Functions, and also to be able to add a really nice web applitcation to my portfolio tha will highly decorate my skill.
